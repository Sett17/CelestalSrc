# CelestalSrc

**Concept**: Visualize a codebase as a night sky, where each function, module, or class is represented as a star. The interconnections between these entities form constellations, providing a unique perspective on the relationships and dependencies within the code.

**Features**:

- **Star Brightness**: The brightness of a star can be determined by several factors:
    - **Activity**: How often a function or module is called or accessed.
    - **Importance**: Critical functions or modules that are central to the application can shine brighter.
    - **Recent Changes**: Recently modified or updated functions can flicker or have a distinct glow.

I want importance to be the default thing. Maybe selectable later?

- **Constellation Formation**:
    - Constellations can be formed based on the relationships between functions or modules. For instance, a group of functions that always work together can form a constellation.
    - Dependencies between different parts of the code can also be visualized as constellations.

Idk what I want here yet.

- **Interactive Sky**: Users can zoom in on specific stars (functions) to get more details (what details? code, docs, ...?)
    
- **Galaxies for Libraries**: External libraries or frameworks used in the project can be visualized as galaxies; with each function or class from the library as a star within that galaxy (or just the galaxy without further relevant content).
    
Maybe later:

- **Time-Lapse Feature**: See how the "night sky" of your codebase evolves over time, visualizing the growth and changes in the code.
